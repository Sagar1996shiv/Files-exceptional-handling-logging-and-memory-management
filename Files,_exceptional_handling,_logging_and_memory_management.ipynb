        " - Exception handling in Python is a way to gracefully handle errors that occur during the execution of a program, so your program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block in Python exception handling is used to define cleanup code that should always run, no matter what‚Äîwhether an exception was raised or not.\n",
        "\n",
        " Purpose of finally :\n",
        "Ensure important final steps (like closing files, releasing resources, or saving state) are always executed.\n",
        "It runs after the try and except blocks, and even if an exception is not caught or if there‚Äôs a return or break.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging in Python is a way to record messages from your program while it runs, often used for debugging, monitoring, or auditing what's happening internally. It's more flexible and powerful than using print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It is invoked automatically when an object is about to be destroyed, usually when there are no more references to it.\n",
        "\n",
        " Purpose of __del__\n",
        "To clean up resources that the object may be holding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Close files\n",

        "It's the opposite of the __init__ constructor method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, both the import statement and the from ... import statement are used to bring code from one module into another, but they do so in different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Using import module\n",
        "\n",
        "Namespace encapsulation: When you import a module using import module, the entire module is brought into your program as a separate namespace. This means you must use the module's name as a prefix to access its attributes or functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using from module import name\n",
        "\n",
        "Direct access: With from module import name, you import specific objects (functions, classes, or variables) from the module directly into your current namespace, so you can use them without the module name as a prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Handle multiple exceptions using various techniques depending on the situation\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Handling Multiple Specific Exceptions Separately\n",
        "Use multiple except blocks to handle different exception types with different logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / x\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"You can't divide by zero.\")\n",
        "Each except handles a specific error type separately.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Handling Multiple Exceptions in One Block\n",
        "Use a tuple to catch multiple exceptions with the same handler:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / x\n",
        "except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "This is useful when the response to multiple errors is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Catching All Exceptions (Not Recommended Generally)\n",
        "Use a bare except: block or catch the base class Exception to catch any exception:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    risky_code()\n",
        "except Exception as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"Something went wrong: {e}\")\n",
        "‚ö†Ô∏è Use this with caution‚Äîit can hide bugs and make debugging harder.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Using else and finally with Multiple Exceptions\n",
        "You can combine exception handling with else and finally:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / x\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"That's not a number.\")\n",

        "finally:\n",
        "    print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement in Python is used to manage resources like files more cleanly and safely. Its main purpose when handling files is to automatically manage opening and closing the file, even if an error occurs during processing.\n",
        "\n",
        " Why use with for file handling?\n",
        "Automatic resource cleanup: Closes the file automatically when the block ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents resource leaks: Ensures files aren‚Äôt left open accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaner code: No need to explicitly call file.close().\n",
        "\n",
        "üß™ Example: Using with\n",
        "python\n",
        "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "    content = file.read()\n",
        "    print(content)\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Multiple threads (lightweight processes) run in the same process and share memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚úÖ Key Points:\n",
        "Runs multiple threads within a single process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads share the same memory (easier communication, but also more prone to bugs like race conditions).\n",
        "\n",
        "In CPython, threads are limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best suited for I/O-bound tasks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "File I/O\n",

        "\n",
        "‚úÖ Key Points:\n",
        "Runs separate processes, each with its own memory and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "No GIL limitation ‚Äì each process has its own Python interpreter.\n",

        "10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Using logging in a program offers several key advantages over simply using print() statements. It's an essential tool for writing robust, maintainable, and production-ready software.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1.Detailed Information Tracking\n",
        " 2.Easier Debugging\n",

        " 6.Reusable and Configurable\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python refers to the way Python handles the allocation, usage, and freeing of memory for your program during its execution. It‚Äôs a crucial part of how Python ensures efficient use of system resources and prevents memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Basic Steps in Exception Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Identify the risky code (try block)\n",
        "\n",
        "Put the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python runs this code and monitors for exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Handle the exception (except block)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use one or more except blocks to catch and respond to specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can catch specific exception types or catch all exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.(Optional) Execute code if no exceptions occur (else block)\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block runs if the try block completes without any exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful for code that should only run when no errors happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Execute cleanup code (finally block)\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block runs always, regardless of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideal for cleaning up resources like closing files or releasing locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management is important in Python for several key reasons that directly impact the performance, reliability, and efficiency of your programs:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 1.Efficient Resource Use\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory is a limited resource. Good management ensures your program uses only what it needs without wasting memory, especially important for large or long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Prevents Memory Leaks\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper memory management avoids memory leaks where unused objects remain allocated, causing the program to consume more and more memory over time, which can eventually crash the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Improves Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory reduce the overhead and slowdowns caused by frequent memory operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps Python run faster and more smoothly by minimizing fragmentation and overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Stability and Reliability\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents unexpected crashes and bugs caused by running out of memory or accessing invalid memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic memory management (reference counting + garbage collection) helps maintain program stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Simplifies Development\n",
        "\n",
        "Python‚Äôs automatic memory management frees developers from manual memory allocation and deallocation, reducing errors and complexity compared to languages like C/C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Handles Complex Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "Many Python objects (lists, dictionaries, classes) are dynamically sized. Good memory management allows these structures to grow and shrink efficiently as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - The try and except blocks are the core components of exception handling in Python. They work together to catch and handle errors gracefully, so your program doesn‚Äôt crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Role of try\n",
        "\n",
        "The try block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python executes this code and watches for any errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no exception occurs, the code inside try runs normally and the program continues.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Role of except\n",
        "\n",
        "The except block catches and handles specific exceptions raised inside the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "If an exception occurs in try, Python jumps to the matching except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no matching except is found, the exception propagates up and may crash the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Core Concepts of Python‚Äôs Garbage Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Reference Counting (Primary Mechanism)\n",
        "\n",
        "Every Python object keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "When an object‚Äôs reference count drops to zero, meaning nothing refers to it anymore, Python immediately frees its memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the simplest and most immediate form of garbage collection in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Handling Reference Cycles (Cycle Detection)\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references (objects referencing each other).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, two objects pointing to each other will never have a reference count of zero, even if no external references exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "To handle this, Python has a cyclic garbage collector that periodically runs to detect and clean up these reference cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Generational Garbage Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "Python‚Äôs cyclic GC organizes objects into generations based on their lifespan:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 0: Newly created objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 1: Objects that survived one GC cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 2: Long-lived objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The GC runs more frequently on younger generations because most objects die young, improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Older generations are checked less often.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - Purpose of the else block:\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block runs only if no exception was raised in the try block. It is used to separate the code that should only execute if the try block succeeded (i.e., did not raise an exception).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Why use else?\n",
        "\n",
        "Using else helps clarify the intent of your code. It keeps the code that depends on the successful completion of the try block separate from the code that handles errors (except) or always runs (finally).\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Python‚Äôs logging module provides several logging levels that indicate the severity of events or messages. These levels help control what gets logged and where.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the common logging levels, from lowest to highest severity:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Level Name\t          Numeric Value\t     Description\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBUG\t                   10\t             Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems during development.\n",
